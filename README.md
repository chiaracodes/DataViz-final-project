# Visualization of Gender Equality in Employment in Europe
Team: PowerPuff Girls
![Gender Inequality](https://www.ilprimatonazionale.it/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/gender-gap.jpg)
This is the final project for the Data Visualization course taught by Dr. Tobias Isenberg at CentraleSupel√©c in 2022.

As the gender wage gap is frequently mentioned in political discussions, policy reports, and the news, as a data-driven individual, it would be interesting to utilize data to study what it actually means. Furthermore, our interest stems from our own believe in gender equality. 
We used data coming from https://stats.oecd.org/ to build a tool that allows to analyze the gender gap, the differences in parental leave and the positions hold by women in decision making across countries.

We utilized Python to develop it, and the key packages we used were Altair, Streamlit, Pandas, and Vegadata. We chose this software and these packages since we were all new to this environment and wanted to learn more about creating interactive visualizations in Python, and the labs held during class were quite inspiring.
