# DataViz-final-project
Team: PowerPuff Girls

This is the final project for the Data Visualization course taught by Dr. Tobias Isenberg at CentraleSupel√©c in 2022.

Reading this report (Economic inequality by gender - Our World in Data ) regarding data and studies on economic inequities between men and women motivated us. As the gender wage gap is frequently mentioned in political discussions, policy reports, and the news, as a data-driven individual, it would be interesting to utilize data to study what it actually means. Furthermore, our interest stems from our own believe in gender equality. 

Among all datasets, we thought this one had the most significant societal impact. Furthermore, as all four members are women preparing to enter the job market, gender inequities in the workplace are an issue we are very interested in, so that we can learn what sort of jobs are available to us. 

This tool can be used by many sources from schools to teach the children the meaning of gender inequality to newspapers and governing bodies that highlight this issue key decision making processes. This tool allows the users to compare countries on gender inequality on different key metrics such as number of maternal and paternal leaves, representation of women in companies and parliaments. 

We utilized Python to develop it, and the key packages we used were Altair, Streamlit, Pandas, and Vegadata. We chose this software and these packages since we were all new to this environment and wanted to learn more about creating interactive visualizations in Python, and the labs held during class were quite inspiring. 

This tools runs on Streamlit on local and it is aslo deployed on Streamlit.io at the following link:
